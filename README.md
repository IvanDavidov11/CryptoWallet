Crypto Portfolio Tracker
This project is a web application designed to help users manage their cryptocurrency portfolios.
It allows users to upload a file containing their crypto holdings, including details such as the coin name, amount owned, and the initial buy price.
The app then fetches real-time data using the CoinLore API to calculate the current portfolio value and track percentage changes in the coin prices over time.

Tech stack:
Back-end: ASP.NET Core
Front-end: React (SPA)
Database: EntityFramework Core for database interactions.
Logging: Serilog for file-based logging.
